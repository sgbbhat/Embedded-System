All the work loads problems are solved separately in 6 different files.

For Part 1, Workload 1, use Q1_WL1.cpp or Q1_WL1 executable
For Part 1, Workload 2, use Q1_WL2.cpp or Q1_WL2 executable
For both these cases, real time clock has been implemented, considering units as secs. 
so please wait for all the results to be printed out once program starts running.

For Part 2, Workload 1, use Q2_WL1.cpp or Q1_WL1 executable
For Part 2, Workload 2, use Q2_WL2.cpp or Q1_WL2 executable
For Part 2, Workload 3, use Q1_WL3.cpp or Q1_WL3 executable
For Part 2, Workload 4, use Q1_WL4.cpp or Q1_WL4 executable
